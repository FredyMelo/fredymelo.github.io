<h1> Hello World </h1> </pre>
<p> It's great to be here! Now that you know my name let me give you the back ground to it. First generation Dominican Puerto Rican from Hyde Park, my early youth consisted of legos, spiderman, and drawing Gundam's. Today I still avidly draw nearly everyday and have coupled this with a new found love for design and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu; two passions that I have encountered less than a year ago.
